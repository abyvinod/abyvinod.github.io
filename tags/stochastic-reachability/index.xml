      <description>Automation, typically, refers to the use of an onboard computer to drives a system to optimize some objective. It makes our day-to-day life simpler and efficient, for example, in transportation (autopilot systems and self-driving cars), space applications, biomedical applications, power grid, and the list goes on and on. However, as we hand over more and more control to the automation, we naturally seek guarantees of safety and performance. After all, we do not want to spend billions of dollar in R&amp;amp;D and develop an automation that may cause harm.</description>
