# Prelude
I have been postponing my foray into blogging for some time now. Well, this
holiday season I decided to present myself with the gift of blogging. I had done
a bit of blogging using [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/) back when I was at
IIT Madras, but my site was hacked due to my neglience of the security settings.
To make things simple, I am choosing a static website for blogging this time. I will
stick with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) due to my comfort level with
Python. 

On reading about Pelican, I discovered that the norm appears to be to replace the customary
"Hello World" post with a post on how one sets up the blog using Pelican.
The journey on understanding Pelican definitely is not straight-forward as one would like to hope for.
However, among the numerous posts I read on the internet, I would like to
especially thank the "Hello World" posts from Mr. Hartley's
[blog](http://beneathdata.com/how-to/how-i-built-this-website), Mr. Vincent's
[blog](http://algorithmshop.com/20131212-starting-a-blog.html/), and Mr.
Jerome's [blog](http://ntanjerome.org/blog/how-to-setup-github-user-page-with-pelican/).

# How did I get my blog setup?

## Setting up Conda and Pelican in Windows

Requirements:

1. [msysgit](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)[^1] to emulate the Unix terminal in my PC. 
1. [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) for easy python package handling

The following steps create a virtual environment in conda for Pelican,
~~~
$ conda create -n blog python=3.5       # Creates a conda environment blog with Python 3.5
$ conda install markdown                # Install markdown
~~~
or download the following environment file [blog](stuff/blog.yml), and do
~~~
$ conda env create -f blog.yml
~~~
Note that pelican-quickstart of pelican (available through the conda-forge
[channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pelican)) does not work. It does
compile an existing pelican blog without any problems. 

To solve this, I fork the bleeding edge (at the time of writing, Pelican
3.7.0.dev0) of Pelican instead.  Unzip the [git
repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/archive/master.zip) into a
directory of your choice, say *PelicanBase*.
~~~
$ source activate blog                  # Activate the conda environment
$ cd PelicanBase
$ python setup.py install               # Install pelican
~~~
This installs pelican and fab.

## Setting up the blog
At this point, we are now ready to start laying the foundation for the blog.
~~~
$ mkdir path/to/blog
$ cd path/to/blog
$ pelican-quickstart                    
~~~
<!-- 
# Should have worked, but will fail
You will have to replace the == in the line number given in the error message
with >=. See [this
conversation](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/2043#issuecomment-268625132)
for more details. 
--> 
*pelican-quickstart* will pose a series of questions that initializes
your blog.

## Creating the first post

Create *firstPost.md* containing a title and date[^2].
~~~
$ mkdir content
$ echo 'Title: Test content
> Date: 2016' > content/firstPost.md      # '>' is autogenerated when ENTER is pressed.
~~~

## Rendering the blog

Fabric is a great tool that works with Pelican to automate publishing.
~~~
$ fab build                             # Builds the blog
$ fab serve                             # Serves the blog at localhost:8000 while holding up the terminal
$ fab regenerate & fab serve &          # Serves the blog at localhost:8000 while freeing the terminal
~~~
I use the third command to work with my blog while typing. The automation
renders the new blog when the webpage is refreshed. To further automate the
refreshing (preview style), you can look into plugins for your favorite
browser. In Firefox, AutoReload is a good add-on.
    
## Updating github pages

I have used the approach highlighted in [this Hello World
post](http://ntanjerome.org/blog/how-to-setup-github-user-page-with-pelican/).
To summarize [that
post](http://ntanjerome.org/blog/how-to-setup-github-user-page-with-pelican/),

1. Ensure that you are on the 'source' branch (Create a new one using *git
checkout -b source* if you haven't already)
+ Add/commit everything except the *output* folder 
+ Create a new branch 'gh-pages'
+ Run the following bash script to automate the *updation of GitHub pages*

I had to also follow the advice given
[here](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/2223#issuecomment-174193643)
to install ghp-import via 
~~~
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ionelmc/python-ghp-import
~~~
as opposed to the standard Conda installation. 

Once ghp-import is properly installed, I use the following script to 
```
commitMSG="$1"
echo $commitMSG
fab build
git commit -am "$commitMSG"
ghp-import output
git checkout master
git merge gh-pages -m "$commitMSG"
git pull
git push -u --all
git checkout source
```
Future updates at Github with the local copy is now easy.
~~~
source bp "Commit Message"
~~~

[^1]: $ sign denotes bash prompt.
[^2]: Title and date is the minimum requirement for a blog post.
