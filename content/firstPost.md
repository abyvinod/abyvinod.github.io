summary: The customary hello world post when blogging with Pelican

# Prelude
I have been postponing my foray into blogging for some time now. Well, this
holiday season I decided to present myself with the gift of blogging. I had done
a bit of blogging using [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/) but my site was
hacked due to my neglience of the security settings. To make things simple, I am
choosing [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) due to my comfort level with
Python. 

On reading about the blogs, the norm appears to be to replace the customary
'Hello World!' post with a post on how one sets up the blog using Pelican. The
journey definitely is not straight-forward as one would like to hope for.

# How did I get this blog setup?

I used [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) to create the python environment
for Pelican, and hosted my blog on GitHub.

Hell yeah!
