summary: The customary hello world post when blogging with Pelican

I have been postponing my foray into blogging for some time now. Well, this
holiday season I decided to present myself with the gift of blogging. I needed
the capability of rendering beautiful math, while not being bogged down by
security settings required for sustainable wiki installations. I wanted to use
Vim to write my blogs, which ruled out WordPress. Since I am comfortable with
Python, I chose Pelican. 

On reading about the blogs, the norm appears to be to replace the customary
'Hello World!' post with a post on how one sets up the blog using Pelican. The
journey definitely is not straight-forward as one would like to hope for.
I used Conda to create the python environment for Pelican, and hosted my blog on
GitHub.

Hell yeah!
