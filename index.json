It makes our day-to-day life simpler and efficient, for example, in transportation (autopilot systems and self-driving cars), space applications, biomedical applications, power grid, and the list goes on and on. However, as we hand over more and more control to the automation, we naturally seek guarantees of safety and performance. After all, we do not want to spend billions of dollar in R\u0026amp;D and develop an automation that may cause harm.\nTable of Contents Why is providing safety guarantees in automated control systems for real-world problems hard? In control theory, we attack real-world problems by formulating a mathematical model and studying its relevant properties. The two key challenges in providing the desired safety guarantees for real-world systems are stochasticity and high-dimensionality.\nStochasticity in our models help us capture human inputs (like actions of the other drivers on the street for the self-driving car problem), disturbance effects (like weather in air navigation/power grid systems), varying parameters (like patient parameters in biomedical devices), and other unmodelled phenomena. For example, we can describe the error between our simplified model and the more complicated true mathematical model via a stochastic error term.\nHigh-dimensional systems evolve as a function of a larger set of states, and thereby allowing the mathematical model to be closer to the reality compared to their low-dimensional models.\nHow do we formally obtain a safety guarantee? Terminal stochastic reach-avoid problem The following information is required:\n the stochastic system dynamics along with the bounded control space, the safe set, and the target set.  We wish to satisfy the following specification:\n Ensure that the system reaches the target set at a finite time horizon (not before). (Reach constraint) Ensure that the system stays within the safe set during the time interval. (Safety constraint)  We seek to address the following verification problem[^2]:\nIdentify the set of initial states and design an admissible controller that maximizes the probability of satisfaction of a specification.\nSuch a specification is called a terminal hitting-time stochastic reach-avoid problem. It is a special class of verification problems, which has been well studied for the past couple of decades in computer science as well as control theory. See this paper by Sean Summers and John Lygeros for more details.\n Given the initial state, we need to pick $\\pi^*$ opposed to $\\pi_2$. Here, growing triangles denote the uncertain trajectories under the application of a control policy $\\pi^\\ast$ and $\\pi_2$, $\\mathcal{X}$ refers to the state space, $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$ refers to the safe set, and $\\mathcal{T}\\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$ refers to the target set.   Stochastic reachability of a target tube: A general framework for safety This problem can be generalized to a time-varying collection of safe sets. Motivated by the classical work of Bertsekas, we call this problem the stochastic reachability of a target tube. This problem is illustrated in Figure 2.\n Design controllers that maximize the probability of staying within the target tube {$\\mathcal{T}_i$}, and characterize the set of initial states $\\mathscr{L}_{\\mathrm{SR}}(⋅)$ that satisfy a minimum reach probability.

This problem is known as the spacecraft rendezvous and docking problem. It is a common requirement for maintenance and resupply missions in space applications. Due to sensing constraints, we wish that the Deputy stays within a line-of-sight cone with respect to Chief. Further, we wish to achieve the docking in a pre-specified time interval while obeying the physical laws that govern the system and constraints on actuation (limited thrust).\n Satellite rendezvous and docking problem   We model the Deputy satellite dynamics in the relative coordinate frame of the Chief. Loosely, we have the following constraints we wish to satisfy apart from the dynamics and control constraints,\n Reach constraint: Reaching a target set centered at the origin. This set can encode relative velocity constraints (should dock slowly) and tolerances in relative position at the time of rendezvous. Avoid constraint: We wish to stay within a safe set, given by a stationary cone (line-of-sight cone) with the tip at the origin.  Formal specification Drive the Deputy satellite such that it\n reaches the target set at a pre-specified time, stays within the safe set (staying out of the avoid set) during the time interval, satisfies the dynamics constraints, and satisfies the control constraints.  Safety problem Identify the set of initial states and synthesize an admissible controller that achieves the given specification with a probability above a pre-specified likelihood threshold. Such initial states will be declared safe.\n For safety-critical applications, it is important that we construct either exact or underapproximations of the set of safe initial states. We do not want to be over-confident in our safety declarations, i.e., declare an initial state safe when it is not really safe.   Results SReachTools can address this question, and generate underapproximations of the set of safe initial states.\n Various underapproximations of the set of initial locations with probability of satisfying the specification greater than 0.8. A Monte-Carlo simulation of the resulting trajectory from one of the safe initial states is also shown.   Figure 2 shows various underapproximations of the set of initial locations obtained using SReachTools. These are the safe initial states from which the Deputy can be driven to satisfy the specification with a likelihood no smaller than 0.8. A Monte-Carlo simulation of the safe trajectory is shown from one of the safe initial states under the synthesized controller. Out of 5 randomly chosen trajectories, only one fails (violates terminal velocity constraints).\n}} -- ","date":1552622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554399427,"objectID":"78f3f54d87bb8c65473636d300ad47e1","permalink":"https://abyvinod.github.io/post/spacecraft/","publishdate":"2019-03-15T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/spacecraft/","section":"post","summary":"Demonstration of stochastic reachability analysis","tags":["stochastic-optimal-control"],"title":"Spacecraft rendezvous problem","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents HAHAHUGOSHORTCODE-TOC0-HBHB\nHigh-level description For reliable autonomy under uncertainty, we must have efficient ways to estimate event likelihood given a stochastic system model.\nExisting methods  Use sampling-based methods like Monte-Carlo simulation.
